ATMEGA16

5x20 glass fuses and fuse holders which can be made into a box.

Proper 1.5 to 2.5sqmm wire for high current connections.

Battery terminals may be spade 6.3mm for lead acid or XT60 for lipos.

Battery itself.

Connectors for easy removal of parts, connectors with reverse polarity protection.

Raspberry Pi model 3B+ (considering latest one is cheapest) 

Raspberry Pi Camera Board, Version 2, Sony IMX219 but any generic interfacable camera would work for simple prototype

For debugging ACS712 current sense modules may be used to monitor current or observe say…how motor current changes based on slope , etc also help detect problems.

Vero boards to make circuits on for example atmega16’s board.

Dupont type male to male wires and male to female wires/ribbon cable with clip-on connectors which don’t get removed in vibrations.

Lots of passives and heatsinks for drivers.
